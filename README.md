# Financial_risk_and_loan_approval

Project Objectives

Risk Score Prediction
Develop a regression model to predict a continuous risk score indicating the likelihood of an individual defaulting on a loan.

Loan Approval Classification
Implement a binary classification model to determine whether an individual's loan application will be approved or denied based on their financial profile.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conduct thorough EDA to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, and understand relationships between key variables influencing loan decisions.

Data Preprocessing
Clean and prepare the dataset by addressing missing values, duplicates, and outliers, ensuring high-quality input for modeling.

Model Building and Evaluation
Construct and assess regression and classification models, using appropriate performance metrics to evaluate their predictive capabilities.
